We visited Gymkhana, an elegant Indian restaurant in Mayfair, London, inspired by the elite clubs of colonial India.

## First Impressions
The restaurant, spread across two levels, features a chic interior with plush booths on the ground floor and a warm ambiance reminiscent of high society clubs. We were seated at a cozy booth, surrounded by rich decor and historical photographs, enhancing the dining experience.

## Drinks
We started with a selection of cocktails from their extensive drink menu, which perfectly complemented the rich flavors of the Indian cuisine.

## Tasting Menu Highlights
1. Kid Goat Keema, Salli, Pao - The Kid Goat Keema, served with crispy salli and soft pao, was a delightful starter that set the tone for the meal.
2. Wild Muntjac Biryani - This biryani was a fragrant and hearty dish, with succulent muntjac meat that melted in the mouth.
3. Butter Chicken Masala - A classic dish, executed to perfection with a rich, creamy sauce and tender chicken.

## Final Thoughts
Gymkhana offers an extraordinary dining experience, combining traditional Indian flavors with modern culinary techniques. The ambiance, service, and food were all exceptional, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking an upscale Indian dining experience in London. Highly recommended for special occasions and gourmet enthusiasts.
