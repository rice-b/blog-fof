We visited OSIP in Bruton, Somerset, a small farm-to-table restaurant partnered with local organic farmers.

## First Impressions
The recently restored building features artwork, dried herbs, and an impressive collection of cookbooks, creating a charming atmosphere.

## Drinks
We enjoyed a glass of skin-contact wine (2018 Osip x Westwell House blend) with our 9-course tasting menu.

## Tasting Menu Highlights
1. Courgette roll with ricotta and smoked almond
2. Courgette soup with gooseberry jam and fried courgette - Delicious with a perfect balance of flavors.
3. Treacle and ale bread with smoked butter - Butter had a hidden center of red miso.
4. Grilled cucumber with russet apple and smoked eel - The eel was outstanding.
5. Roasted alliums with yeast and buckwheat - Enhanced by preserved lemons and homemade red miso.
6. Trout with burnt tomato miso and broccoli - Least favorite but still good.
7. Salt marsh lamb with preserved walnut and almond sauce - Rich and flavorful.
8. Old Burford cheese with fermented honey and truffle - A delightful addition.
9. Cherry sorbet with verjus - Refreshing with a perfect pairing of gin.
10. Ewe's milk pudding with apricot and meadowsweet - Smooth and satisfying.

## Petit Fours
Honey madeleine with tonka bean custard concluded the meal beautifully.

## Final Thoughts
OSIP offers an exceptional dining experience with a focus on sustainability and local ingredients. Highly recommended for its unique dishes and cozy ambiance.
